Experiment Overview:
  • Utilized histogram equalization on the color channels (Red, Green, Blue) of the 'BHO' image to enhance its visual appearance.
  • Compared and displayed the original image alongside the image after histogram equalization.
Findings:
Original Image:
  • Displayed the 'BHO' image in its original form with its inherent color and contrast characteristics.
Histogram Equalized Image:
  • After applying histogram equalization to individual color channels, the image showed enhanced contrast and brightness.
  • Colors and details within the image became more vivid and distinct compared to the 
original.
Observations:
  • Histogram equalization significantly improved the image's visual quality by redistributing pixel intensities and enhancing contrast.
  • Enhanced colors and details made the image more visually appealing and clearer to the viewer.
Conclusion:
The application of histogram equalization on the color channels of the 'BHO' image effectively improved its visual appearance by enhancing contrast and color distribution. This technique successfully brought out 
finer details and made the image more visually appealing.
